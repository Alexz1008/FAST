## Introduction
Online marketplaces are useful for getting rid of unwanted items, such as old textbooks, and getting great deals on products. Unfortunately, there is currently no safe platform protecting students from scams or malicious strangers. We at Team Fast and Sustainable Tritons (FAST) are dedicated to solving this problem with Triton Market, a web application dedicated to providing students at the UCSD the ability to safely and efficiently buy and sell products. Our web application enables students to securely sign up for an account with their UCSD email, browse and engage with listings of items being sold by other members of the UCSD community, and have conversations with other users toward meeting up and completing transactions.

## Login Credentials
We have provided several accounts to test with.  The test cases will prompt when to use each one.  The main testing account will be Timmy Triton, and the other two will be for specific test cases that require more than one user.

## Known Bugs
Sometimes, an error occurs saying you cannot edit your own listing after switching accounts.  **If this occurs, please close the tab and reopen the app before logging in to the second account.**

In the messaging page, the button for “Confirm Transaction” doesn’t appear for the seller until page is reloaded.
Changing your name through your profile does not change the name displayed on listings you have already created.

If other bugs are found while the app is running, try to wait longer in between button presses, because Firebase can sometimes be slow to respond.  Also, if something does not load, please try refreshing the page.
